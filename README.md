Twilio API bulk SMS sending script for Windows


Just download files to your Windows PC.

Open twilio.vbs in text editor, fill your twilio credentials at fields "Account_SID =", "Auth_Token = " and "Messaging_SID =". Fill your twilio number in "NumberFrom =". Find "Message = " and type SMS message for sending. Save file.

Open twilionumbers.txt in text editor, fill phone numbers for SMS sending, like in sample. Save file.

Just run twilio.vbs and wait for message "SMS sending complete, please see twilioresult.txt for log". Your sending complete, see log file twilioresult.txt .

If you have cellular operators restrictions in country for sending, like a ban for advertising bulk SMS sending. It is possible to solve, but need code upgrade. Contact me at 18reklama@gmail.com .
